> Compute approximate development time spent on a project, using logs from version control system.

* * *

## How it works ?

**tankipas**, according to the options used, read the logs of the current working directory's version control system and computes the difference between each commit timestamp.   
As the resulting time **can't** reflect the reality, **tankipas** use a `gap` option, a number of minutes above wich the time between two commits is ignored.

## Usage as node.js module

### Installation

To use **tankipas** as a node.js module, install it first to your project.

    npm install --save tankipas
    
### Usage

Using **tankipas** is simple, after require it : 

    tankipas = require( "tankipas" );
    
    tankipas( ".", {}, function( oError, iTotal ) {
        // do awesome things here.
    } );
    
### Signature

    tankipas( sRepositoryPath [, oOptions [, fCallback ] ] )
    
#### Arguments

- `sRepoPath` is the path to the repository to analyse.
- `oOptions` is an object which can contain the following properties :
    - `system`: force the version system to analyse (by default, try to guess)
    - `gap`: number of minutes above wich the time between two commits is ignored in the total (default to `120`)
    - `user`: use only the commits of the given user
    - `commit`: compute the result since the given commit
    - `branch`: use only the commits of the given branch
- `fCallback` is the callback function, which returns two arguments : 
    - `oError`: if an error occurs during the process
    - `iTotal`: the total of time spent on the project, in seconds
    
## Usage as *command-line tool*

### Installation

To use **tankipas** as a command-line tool, it is preferable to install it globally.

    (sudo) npm install -g tankipas

### Usage

Using **tankipas** is simple, from inside a `git` or `mercurial` repo: 

    tankipas [options]
    
    Options:

        -h, --help             output usage information
        -V, --version          output the version number
        -s, --system <system>  force the version system to analyse (by default, try to guess)
        -g, --gap <amount>     number of minutes above wich the time between two commits is ignored in the total.
        -u, --user <user>      use only the commits of the given user.
        -c, --commit <commit>  compute the result since the given commit.
        -b, --branch <branch>  use only the commits of the given branch.
        -r, --raw              show raw result, as number of seconds spent on the project.
    
#### Options

##### system (`-s`,`--system <system>`)

Force the version control system to use for the current directory's analysis.  
By default, **tankipas** will try to guess the current version control system.

For now, **tankipas** supports `git` and `mercurial` systems.

##### gap (`-g`,`--gap <amount>`)

**tankipas** compute his result by sum all the time between commits. As you can't pretend working 24h/day (*I tried, it's hard, after 3 days*), **tankipas** ignore the time between commits separed by more than the given `gap` option. By default, the gap is `120` (minutes).

##### user (`-u`,`--user <user>`)

If you work as a team, you can be interested to filters the commits and compute the time of only one user, which you can precise with the `user` option.

##### commit (`-c`,`--commit <commit>`)

The result will be computed since the given commit reference, instead of the beginning of the project.

##### branch (`-b`,`--branch <branch>`)

You can filters the commits and compute the time of only one branch, which you can precise with the `branch` option.

##### raw (`-r`,`--raw`)

By default, **tankipas** outputs his result in a *human-readable* format. If you want to use the result with another tool, the `raw` option will output results as an amount of `seconds`.

##### help (`-h`,`--help`)

Output usage information.

##### version (`-v`,`--version`)

Output **tankipas**' version number.

## Usage as grunt plugin

Please refer to the [grunt-tankipas](https://github.com/leny/grunt-tankipas) documentation.
